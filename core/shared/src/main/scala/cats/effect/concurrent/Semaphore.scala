 * decrements the current number of permits and releasing a permit increases
 * the current number of permits. An acquire that occurs when there are no
 * permits available results in semantic blocking until a permit becomes available.
 *
 * Blocking acquires are cancelable if the semaphore is created with `Semaphore.apply`
 * (and hence, with a `Concurrent[F]` instance). Blocking acquires are non-cancelable
 * if the semaphore is created with `Semaphore.async` (and hence, with an `Async[F]` instance).
